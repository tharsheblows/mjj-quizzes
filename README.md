This is a WordPress plugin which makes simple little quizzes. It works by giving each answer a point value and then sums them up to give a result based on the score.

It makes a custom post type called "Quizzes". For each questions, give some answers and the point value for each answer. (You might need to change the styles depending on how many answers per question you have.) Then put in the ranges and info for the results. You'll need to do it like 0-99, 100-199 -- ie, don't include the same number twice. 

Then take the quiz!
